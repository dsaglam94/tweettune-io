### Why this project?

I built this project to figure out how to implement new ChatGPT API to my projects and grasp what is possible.

Also as someone not having English as their native language, sometimes it becomes very burdensome to write a good tweet sounds natural and correct. That's why I was using ChatGPT to check or correct my tweets before tweeting them. This project is a way to simplfy this process for my own sake. And thought it might be benefical to others, too.

I've got the inspration from [Hassan El Mghari](https://twitter.com/nutlope)'s wonderful project [twitterBio](https://www.twitterbio.com/). Special thanks to his videos and blog posts about Vercel's Edge Functions with streaming and implementing openAI's API.
